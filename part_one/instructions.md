You tried to launch Automaton but it didn't work. As an experienced engineer you noticed that the code was really buggy and decided to debug it.

Your task is to re-corde automaton so it starts working again(passes all the tests).

In order to run the tests, run:

`yarn run first` or `npm run first`
